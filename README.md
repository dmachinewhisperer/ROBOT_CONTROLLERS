# Robot Controller: PID Implementations

Welcome to the Robot Controller repository. This repository is dedicated to providing implementations of common PID controllers for different robots. There are two implementations so far:  for a UAV (quadcopter) and a self-balancing project.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders, each catering to a specific type of robot:

### 1. Flight Controller

The `flight controller` folder is for a quadcopter. Find PID controller implementations for flight control. 

### 2. Self-Balancing

The `self-balancing` folder is for self-balancing robots. 

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the PID controller implementations in this repository, navigate to the respective folder of your robot project and start tweaking the gains. 

## Dependencies
See the `CMakeLists.txt` in each project to correctly configure the required components before compiling.
